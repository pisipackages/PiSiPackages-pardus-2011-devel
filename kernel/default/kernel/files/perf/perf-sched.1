.SH "NAME"
perf-sched \- Tool to trace/measure scheduler properties (latencies)
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fIperf sched\fR {record|latency|replay|trace}
.fi
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
There are four variants of perf sched:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\'perf sched record <command>\' to record the scheduling events
of an arbitrary workload\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\'perf sched latency\' to report the per task scheduling latencies
and other scheduling properties of the workload\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\'perf sched trace\' to see a detailed trace of the workload that
was recorded\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\'perf sched replay\' to simulate the workload that was recorded
via perf sched record\&. (this is done by starting up mockup threads
that mimic the workload based on the events in the trace\&. These
threads can then replay the timings (CPU runtime and sleep patterns)
of the workload as it occurred when it was recorded \- and can repeat
it a number of times, measuring its performance\&.)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP

.RS 4
Display verbose dump of the sched data\&.
