 		<h4 id="descr">Description</h4>
 		<p>The <tt>ntpd</tt> program is an operating system daemon that synchronises the system clock with remote NTP&nbsp;time servers or local reference clocks. It is a complete implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) version 4, but also retains compatibility with version 3, as defined by RFC-1305, and version 1 and 2, as defined by RFC-1059 and RFC-1119, respectively. The program can operate in any of several modes, as described on the <a href="assoc.html">Association Management</a> page, and with both symmetric key and public key cryptography, as described on the <a href="manyopt.html">Authentication Options</a> page.</p>
 		<p>The <tt>ntpd</tt> program ordinarily requires a configuration file as desccribe on the Configuration Commands and Options collection above. However a client can discover remote servers and configure them automatically. This makes it possible to deploy a fleet of workstations without specifying configuration details specific to the local environment. Further details are on the <a href="manyopt.html">Automatic Server Discovery</a> page.</p>

 		<p>The issues should be carefully considered before using these options. The maximum slew rate possible is limited to 500 parts-per-million (PPM) by the Unix kernel. As a result, the clock can take 2000 s for each second the clock is outside the acceptable range. During this interval the clock will not be consistent with any other network clock and the system cannot be used for distributed applications that require correctly synchronized network time.</p>
 		<p>The frequency file, usually called <tt>ntp.drift</tt>, contains the latest estimate  of clock frequency. If this file does not exist when <tt>ntpd</tt> is started, it enters a special mode designed to measure the particular frequency directly. The measurement takes 15 minutes, after which the frequency is set and <tt>ntpd</tt> resumes normal mode where the time and frequency are continuously adjusted. The frequency file is updated at intervals of an hour or more depending on the measured clock stability.</p>

With the <tt>-q</tt> option <tt>ntpd</tt> operates as in continous mode, but exits just after setting the clock for the first time. Most applications will probably want to specify the <tt>iburst</tt> option with the <tt>server</tt> command.

 		<h4 id="poll">Poll Interval Control</h4>
 		<p>NTP uses an intricate heuristic algorithm to automatically control the poll interval for maximum accuracy consistent with minimum network overhead. The algorithm measures the incidental offset and jitter to determine the best poll interval. When <tt>ntpd</tt> starts, the interval is the default minimum 64 s. Under normal conditions when the clock discipline has stabilized, the interval increases in steps to the default maximum 1024 s. In addition, should a server become unreachable after some time, the interval increases in steps to the maximum in order to reduce network overhead.</p>
 		<p>The default poll interval range is suitable for most conditions, but can be changed using options on the <a href="confopt.html">Server Options</a> and <a href="miscopt.html">Miscellaneous Options</a> pages. However, when using maximum intervals much larger than the default, the residual clock frequency error must be small enough for the discipline loop to capture and correct. The capture range is 500 PPM with a 64-s interval decreasing by a factor of two for each interval doubling. At a 36-hr interval, for example, the capture range is only 0.24 PPM.</p>

A number of samples are obtained from each of the servers specified and a subset of the NTP clock filter and selection algorithms are applied to select the best of these.

+		<p><tt>ntpdate</tt> sets the local date and time by polling the Network Time Protocol (NTP) server(s) given as the <i>server</i> arguments to determine the correct time. It must be run as root on the local host. A number of samples are obtained from each of the servers specified and a subset of the NTP clock filter and selection algorithms are applied to select the best of these. Note that the accuracy and reliability of <tt>ntpdate</tt> depends on the number of servers, the number of polls each time it is run and the interval between runs.</p>
 		<p><tt>ntpdate</tt> can be run manually as necessary to set the host clock, or it can be run from the host startup script to set the clock at boot time. This is useful in some cases to set the clock initially before starting the NTP daemon <tt>ntpd</tt>. It is also possible to run <tt>ntpdate</tt> from a <tt>cron</tt> script. However, it is important to note that <tt>ntpdate</tt> with contrived <tt>cron</tt> scripts is no substitute for the NTP daemon, which uses sophisticated algorithms to maximize accuracy and reliability while minimizing resource use. Finally, since <tt>ntpdate</tt> does not discipline the host clock frequency as does <tt>ntpd</tt>, the accuracy using <tt>ntpdate</tt> is limited.</p>
 		<p>Time adjustments are made by <tt>ntpdate</tt> in one of two ways. If <tt>ntpdate</tt> determines the clock is in error more than 0.5 second it will simply step the time by calling the system <tt>settimeofday()</tt> routine. If the error is less than 0.5 seconds, it will slew the time by calling the system <tt>adjtime()</tt> routine. The latter technique is less disruptive and more accurate when the error is small, and works quite well when <tt>ntpdate</tt> is run by <tt>cron</tt> every hour or two.</p>
 		<p><tt>ntpdate</tt> will decline to set the date if an NTP server daemon (e.g., <tt>ntpd</tt>) is running on the same host. When running <tt>ntpdate</tt> on a regular basis from <tt>cron</tt> as an alternative to running a daemon, doing so once every hour or two will result in precise enough timekeeping to avoid stepping the clock.</p>

 		<h4>Description</h4>
-		<tt>ntpdc</tt> is used to query the <tt>ntpd</tt> daemon about its current state and to request changes in that state. The program may be run either in interactive mode or controlled using command line arguments. Extensive state and statistics information is available through the <tt>ntpdc</tt> interface. In addition, nearly all the configuration options which can be specified at startup using ntpd's configuration file may also be specified at run time using <tt>ntpdc</tt>.

In addition, nearly all the configuration options which can be specified at startup using ntpd's configuration file may also be specified at run time using <tt>ntpdc</tt>.</p>
 		<p>If one or more request options are included on the command line when <tt>ntpdc</tt> is executed, each of the requests will be sent to the NTP servers running on each of the hosts given as command line arguments, or on localhost by default. If no request options are given, <tt>ntpdc</tt> will attempt to read commands from the standard input and execute these on the NTP server running on the first host given on the command line, again defaulting to localhost when no other host is specified. <tt>ntpdc</tt> will prompt for commands if the standard input is a terminal device.</p>
 		<p><tt>ntpdc</tt> uses NTP mode 7 packets to communicate with the NTP server, and hence can be used to query any compatible server on the network which permits it. Note that since NTP is a UDP protocol this communication will be somewhat unreliable, especially over large distances in terms of network topology. <tt>ntpdc</tt> makes no attempt to retransmit requests, and will time requests out if the remote host is not heard from within a suitable timeout time.</p>
 		<p>The operation of <tt>ntpdc</tt> are specific to the particular implementation of the <tt>ntpd</tt> daemon and can be expected to work only with this and maybe some previous versions of the daemon. Requests from a remote <tt>ntpdc</tt> program which affect the state of the local server must be authenticated, which requires both the remote program and local server share a common key and key identifier.</p>

+		<p><tt>tickadj [ -Aqs ] [ -a <i>tickadj</i> ] [ -t <i>tick</i> ]</tt></p>
 		<h4>Description</h4>
 		<p>The <tt>tickadj</tt> program reads, and optionally modifies, several timekeeping-related variables in older kernels that do not have support for precision ttimekeeping, including HP-UX, SunOS, Ultrix, SGI and probably others. Those machines provide means to patch the kernel <tt>/dev/kmem</tt>. Newer machines with kernel time support, including Solaris, Tru64, FreeBSD and Linux, should NOT use the program, even if it appears to work, as it will destabilize the kernel time support. Use the <a href="ntptime.html"><tt>ntptime</tt></a> program instead.</p>
 		<p>The particular variables that can be changed with <tt>tickadj</tt> include <tt>tick</tt>, which is the number of microseconds added to the system time for a clock interrupt, <tt>tickadj</tt>, which sets the slew rate and resolution used by the <tt>adjtime</tt> system call, and <tt>dosynctodr</tt>, which indicates to the kernels on some machines whether they should internally adjust the system clock to keep it in line with time-of-day clock or not.</p>
+		<p>On Linux, only the <tt>tick</tt> variable is supported and the only allowed argument is the tick value.</p>
 		<p>By default, with no arguments, <tt>tickadj</tt> reads the variables of interest in the kernel and displays them. At the same time, it determines an &quot;optimal&quot; value for the value of the <tt>tickadj</tt> variable if the intent is to run the <tt>ntpd</tt> Network Time Protocol (NTP) daemon, and prints this as well. Since the operation of <tt>tickadj</tt> when reading the kernel mimics the operation of similar parts of the <tt>ntpd</tt> program fairly closely, this can be useful when debugging problems with <tt>ntpd</tt>.</p>
 		<p>Note that <tt>tickadj</tt> should be run with some caution when being used for the first time on different types of machines. The operations which <tt>tickadj</tt> tries to perform are not guaranteed to work on all Unix machines and may in rare cases cause the kernel to crash.</p>
