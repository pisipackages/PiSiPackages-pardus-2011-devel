# This file contains valid path list for pisi sandbox
# and used in the build process to constrain actions.py inside
# the build directories

# Paths like /tmp allow writing to /tmp2/lala
# while /tmp/ only allows inside the /tmp directory
# ~ at the beginning of the path is replaced by pisi user's home directory

# Each package has its build directory (/var/pisi/pkgname) allowed by default
# And ccache directory is automatically added when that feature is enabled
# Any other extra path should be configured here

# Generic system paths needed by almost all programs
