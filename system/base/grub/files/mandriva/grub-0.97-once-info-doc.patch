 new kernel fails (e.g. it panics), you can specify that GRUB should
 try the new kernel only once and boot the old kernel after that.
 
-First, modify your configuration file. Here is an example:
+To tell GRUB to boot the new kernel at next boot
+time, execute @command{grub}, and use @dfn{savedefault}:
 
 @example
-@group
-default saved        # This is important!!!
-timeout 10
-
-title the old kernel
-root (hd0,0)
-kernel /old_kernel
-savedefault
-
-title the new kernel
-root (hd0,0)
-kernel /new_kernel
-savedefault 0         # This is important!!!
-@end group
-@end example
-
-Note that this configuration file uses @samp{default saved}
-(@pxref{default}) at the head and @samp{savedefault 0}
-(@pxref{savedefault}) in the entry for the new kernel. This means
-that GRUB boots a saved entry by default, and booting the entry for the
-new kernel saves @samp{0} as the saved entry.
-
-With this configuration file, after all, GRUB always tries to boot the
-old kernel after it booted the new one, because @samp{0} is the entry
-of @code{the old kernel}.
-
-The next step is to tell GRUB to boot the new kernel at next boot
-time. For this, execute @command{grub-set-default} (@pxref{Invoking
-grub-set-default}):
-
-@example
-# @kbd{grub-set-default 1}
-@end example
-
-This command sets the saved entry to @samp{1}, that is, to the new
-kernel.
-
-This method is useful, but still not very robust, because GRUB stops
-booting, if there is any error in the boot entry, such that the new
-kernel has an invalid executable format. Thus, it it even better to
-use the @dfn{fallback} mechanism of GRUB. Look at next subsection for
-this feature.
-
-
-@node Booting fallback systems
-@subsection Booting fallback systems
-
-GRUB supports a fallback mechanism of booting one or more other
-entries if a default boot entry fails. You can specify multiple
-fallback entries if you wish.
-
-Suppose that you have three systems, @samp{A}, @samp{B} and
-@samp{C}. @samp{A} is a system which you want to boot by
-default. @samp{B} is a backup system which is supposed to boot
-safely. @samp{C} is another backup system which is used in case where
-@samp{B} is broken.
-
-Then you may want GRUB to boot the first system which is bootable
-among @samp{A}, @samp{B} and @samp{C}. A configuration file can be
-written in this way:
-
-@example
-@group
-default saved        # This is important!!!
-timeout 10
-fallback 1 2         # This is important!!!
-
-title A
-root (hd0,0)
-kernel /kernel
-savedefault fallback # This is important!!!
-
-title B
-root (hd1,0)
-kernel /kernel
-savedefault fallback # This is important!!!
-
-title C
-root (hd2,0)
-kernel /kernel
-savedefault
-@end group
+# @kbd{savedefault --default 1 --once}
 @end example
 
-Note that @samp{default saved} (@pxref{default}), @samp{fallback 1 2}
-and @samp{savedefault fallback} are used. GRUB will boot a saved entry
-by default and save a fallback entry as next boot entry with this
-configuration.
-
-When GRUB tries to boot @samp{A}, GRUB saves @samp{1} as next boot
-entry, because the command @command{fallback} specifies that @samp{1}
-is the first fallback entry. The entry @samp{1} is @samp{B}, so GRUB
-will try to boot @samp{B} at next boot time.
-
-Likewise, when GRUB tries to boot @samp{B}, GRUB saves @samp{2} as
-next boot entry, because @command{fallback} specifies @samp{2} as next
-fallback entry. This makes sure that GRUB will boot @samp{C} after
-booting @samp{B}.
-
-It is noteworthy that GRUB uses fallback entries both when GRUB
-itself fails in booting an entry and when @samp{A} or @samp{B} fails
-in starting up your system. So this solution ensures that your system
-is started even if GRUB cannot find your kernel or if your kernel
-panics.
-
-However, you need to run @command{grub-set-default} (@pxref{Invoking
-grub-set-default}) when @samp{A} starts correctly or you fix @samp{A}
-after it crashes, since GRUB always sets next boot entry to a fallback
-entry. You should run this command in a startup script such as
-@file{rc.local} to boot @samp{A} by default:
-
-@example
-# @kbd{grub-set-default 0}
-@end example
-
-where @samp{0} is the number of the boot entry for the system
-@samp{A}.
-
-If you want to see what is current default entry, you can look at the
-file @file{/boot/grub/default} (or @file{/grub/default} in
-some systems). Because this file is plain-text, you can just
-@command{cat} this file. But it is strongly recommended @strong{not to
-modify this file directly}, because GRUB may fail in saving a default
-entry in this file, if you change this file in an unintended
-manner. Therefore, you should use @command{grub-set-default} when you
-need to change the default entry.
+This command sets the default entry to @samp{1} for next boot.

-The program @command{grub-set-default} sets the default boot entry for
-GRUB. This automatically creates a file named @file{default} under
-your GRUB directory (i.e. @file{/boot/grub}), if it is not
-present. This file is used to determine the default boot entry when
-GRUB boots up your system when you use @samp{default saved} in your
-configuration file (@pxref{default}), and to save next default boot
-entry when you use @samp{savedefault} in a boot entry
-(@pxref{savedefault}).
-
-@command{grub-set-default} accepts the following options:
-
-@table @option
-@item --help
-Print a summary of the command-line options and exit.
-
-@item --version
-Print the version information and exit.
-
-@item --root-directory=@var{dir}
-Use the directory @var{dir} instead of the root directory
-(i.e. @file{/}) to define the location of the default file. This
-is useful when you mount a disk which is used for another system.

-
-You must specify a single argument to @command{grub-set-default}. This
-argument is normally the number of a default boot entry. For example,
-if you have this configuration file:
-
-@example
-@group
-default saved
-timeout 10
-
-title GNU/Hurd
-root (hd0,0)
-...
-
-title GNU/Linux

-
-and if you want to set the next default boot entry to GNU/Linux, you
-may execute this command:
-
-@example
-@kbd{grub-set-default 1}
-@end example
-
-Because the entry for GNU/Linux is @samp{1}. Note that entries are
-counted from zero. So, if you want to specify GNU/Hurd here, then you
-should specify @samp{0}.
