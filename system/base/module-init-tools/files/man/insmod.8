.SH NAME
insmod \- simple program to insert a module into the Linux Kernel
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBinsmod\fR [ \fB\fIfilename\fB\fR ]  [ \fB\fImodule options\fB\fR\fI...\fR ] 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBinsmod\fR is a trivial program to insert a
module into the kernel: if the
\fIfilename\fR is a hyphen, the module is
taken from standard input. Most users will want to use
\fBmodprobe\fR(8) instead, which is
more clever and can handle module dependencies.
.PP
Only the most general of error messages are reported: as the
work of trying to link the module is now done inside the kernel,
the \fBdmesg\fR usually gives more information
about errors.
