.SH NAME
modules.dep.bin, modules.dep \- Module dependency information
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fImodules.dep.bin\fR as generated by
module-init-tools \fBdepmod\fR, lists the
dependencies for every module in the directories under
\fI/lib/modules/\fR\fIversion\fR,
where \fImodules.dep.bin\fR (or the human readable
version \fImodules.dep\fR) is also located. It is
used by utilities such as \fBmodprobe\fR\&. The
binary version will be used by default, if it was generated by
a compatible version of \fBdepmod\fR, with fallback
to the generic \fImodules.dep\fR\&.
.PP
These files are not intended for editing or use by any additional
utilities as their format is subject to change in the future. You
should use the
\fBmodinfo\fR(8) command to obtain information about modules in a future
proof and compatible fashion rather than touching these files.
