Subject: [patch] Fix GNU/Linux core open: Can't read pathname for load map:  Input/output error.

Hi,

GDB currently always prints on loading a core file:
	warning: Can't read pathname for load map: Input/output error.

The patch is not nice but it was WONTFIXed on the glibc side in:
	http://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2009-10/msg00001.html

The same message in GDB PR 8882 and glibc PR 387 was for ld-linux.so.2 l_name
but that one is now ignored thanks to IGNORE_FIRST_LINK_MAP_ENTRY.

This fix is intended for Linux system vDSO l_name which is a second entry in
the DSO list.

Regression tested on {x86_86,x86_64-m32,i686}-fedora11-linux-gnu.


Thanks,
Jan

	Do not print false warning on reading core file with vDSO on GNU/Linux.
	* solib-svr4.c (svr4_current_sos): Suppress the warning if
	MASTER_SO_LIST is still NULL.
	* solib.c (update_solib_list): New variable saved_so_list_head.
	Conditionally restart the function.
