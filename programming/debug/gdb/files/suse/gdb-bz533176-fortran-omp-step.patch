I find it a bug in DWARF and gdb behaves correctly according to it.  From the
current DWARF's point of view the is a function call which you skip by "next".

If you hide any /usr/lib/debug such as using:
gdb -nx -ex 'set debug-file-directory /qwe' -ex 'file ./tpcommon_gfortran44'
and use "step" command instead of "next" there it will work.
(You need to hide debuginfo from libgomp as you would step into libgomp sources
to maintain the threads for execution.)

There should be some DWARF extension for it, currently tried to detect
substring ".omp_fn." as this function is called "MAIN__.omp_fn.0" and do not
consider such sub-function as a skippable by "next".

Another problem is that with "set scheduler-locking" being "off" (default
upstream) or "step" (default in F/RHEL) the simultaneous execution of the
threads is inconvenient.  Setting it to "on" will lockup the debugging as the
threads need to get synchronized at some point.  This is a more general
debugging problem of GOMP outside of the scope of this Bug.
