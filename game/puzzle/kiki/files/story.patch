+once upon a time,
+there were some 
+tiny little robots
+living in the nano world.
+
+
+they lived a happy artificial life
+busily collecting resources
+for the maker
+who made more and more
+tiny little robots.
+ 
+but one day,
+a parasitic capacity
+destroyed the maker's
+master control program.
+ 
+since then he is
+malfunctioning
+and only producing
+lazy stupid little robots
+which shoot each other
+and destroy the nano world.
+ 
+your task is to help kiki,
+the only sane bot left over,
+to repair the maker.
