# irqbalance is a daemon process that distributes interrupts across
# CPUS on SMP systems.  The default is to rebalance once every 10
# seconds.  There is one configuration option:
#
# ONESHOT=yes
#    after starting, wait for a minute, then look at the interrupt
#    load and balance it once; after balancing exit and do not change
#    it again.
ONESHOT=

#
# IRQ_AFFINITY_MASK
#    64 bit bitmask which allows you to indicate which cpu's should
#    be skipped when reblancing irqs.  Cpu numbers which have their 
#    corresponding bits set to zero in this mask will not have any
#    irq's assigned to them on rebalance
