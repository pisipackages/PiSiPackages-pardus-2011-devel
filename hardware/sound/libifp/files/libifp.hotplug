# Red Hat with gphoto2. In principle we could just call that one,
# but it's ugly to depend on a camera driver in order to talk
# to an audio player...

# Sets up newly plugged-in iRiver iFP device so that the user who owns
# the console according to pam_console can access it from user space
#
# Note that for this script to work, you'll need all of the following:
# a) a line in the file /etc/hotplug/usb/libifp.usermap that corresponds 
#    to the iFP device you are using.
# b) a setup using pam_console creates the respective lock files
#    containing the name of the respective user. You can check for that
#    by executing "echo `cat /var/{run,lock}/console.lock`" and 
#    verifying the appropriate user is mentioned somewhere there.
# c) a Linux kernel supporting hotplug and usbdevfs
# d) the hotplug package (http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net/)
#
# All of the above are expected to be true on recent Red Hat and Fedora
# distributions in the default install.
#
# In the usermap file, the first field "usb module" should be named 
# "libifp" like this script.
