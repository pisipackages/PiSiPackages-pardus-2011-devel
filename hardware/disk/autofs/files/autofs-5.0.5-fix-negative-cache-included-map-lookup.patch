autofs-5.0.5 - fix negative cache included map lookup

From: Ian Kent <raven@themaw.net>

If we are looking up a mount from multiple included map sources we
can't update the negative cache until we have looked at all sources.
If we don't postpone the negative cache update we will get a false
negative on a subsequent lookups.

Also clean up "not found" message.
