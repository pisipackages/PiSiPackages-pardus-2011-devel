.TH UIF2ISO "1" "January 2009" "uif2iso " "User Commands"
.SH NAME
uif2iso \- converts uif files to iso or other formats.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B uif2iso
\fI<input.UIF> <output>\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
UIF2ISO converts single and multipart UIF (Universal Image Format) images
(generated by the MagicISO program) to their original format.
.PP
The output format (iso, cue/bin, mds/mdf, ccd, nrg) and corresponding
extension are automatically chosen by the tool, depending on what the
original format of the input file was.
.SH KNOWN ISSUES
When extracting a NRG image, the resulting file might be invalid.  However,
in these cases, an additional valid CUE file is created. So if the NRG file
were to not work, the CUE file can be used instead.
.SH SEE ALSO
For more information regarding why this tool is needed and what the output
formats are, see the uif2iso.txt file provided along with this program.
