Subject: [PATCH 144/147] shm: don't complain about missing SHM segments

If two clients try to cleanup the SHM directory at the same time, they
might want to open and then delete the same segment at the same time, in
which case one client might win, the other one lose. In this case, don't
warn about ENOENT.
