+This is Debian's prepackaged version of the `jpeg library' by the Independent
+JPEG Group.
+
+This package was created by Mark Mickan <mmickan@debian.org> from sources
+which can be found at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz
+
+It is partly based on the libjpeg6a package originally put together by
+Andy Guy <awpguy@acs.ucalgary.ca> and later maintained by Mark Mickan.
+
+Current Debian maintainer is Bill Allombert <ballombe@debian.org>.

+LEGAL ISSUES [ from README supplied with source - MM ]
+============
+
+In plain English:
+
+1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,
+   please let us know!)
+2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.
+3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a
+   program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
+   you've used the IJG code.
+
+In legalese:
+
+The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
+with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
+fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
+its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.
+
+This software is copyright (C) 1991-2009, Thomas G. Lane, Guido Vollbeding.
+All Rights Reserved except as specified below.
+
+Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
+software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
+conditions:
+(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
+README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
+unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
+must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
+(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
+documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
+the Independent JPEG Group".
+(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
+full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
+NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.
+
+These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
+not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
+acknowledge us.
+
+Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
+in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
+it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
+software".
+
+We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
+commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
+assumed by the product vendor.
+
+
+ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
+sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
+ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
+by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
+that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
+ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
+of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
+the foregoing paragraphs do.
+
+The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
+It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
+The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
+ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
+by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.
+
+It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
+patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot
+legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,
+support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
+(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
+Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
+So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
+code.
+
+The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
+To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
+been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
+"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
+resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
+GIF decoders.
+
+We are required to state that
+    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
+    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
+    CompuServe Incorporated."
